The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including versions 1.0.1 and 2.2.1 does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse` should restrict parsing of `__proto__` keys when parsing JSON strings to objects. As a point of reference, the `JSON.parse` method included in JavaScript ignores `__proto__` keys. Simply changing `JSON5.parse` to `JSON.parse` in the examples above mitigates this vulnerability. This vulnerability is patched in json5 versions 1.0.2, 2.2.2, and later.","vulnerability,security,HIGH","high","2024-03-28T14:19:49Z","2024-03-28T14:19:49Z","2024-08-08T19:55:28Z","",,"30","0","https://dev.azure.com/octodemo-felickz/07458afa-663a-4793-bc69-c43e4ced7a96/_git/aadaee5b-159c-46f6-b2e0-bede44f0322a/alerts/687?branch=refs/heads/master","octodemo-felickz","iac-synthetics","iac-synthetics","refs/heads/master",,"",""

The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including versions 1.0.1 and 2.2.1 does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse` should restrict parsing of `__proto__` keys when parsing JSON strings to objects. As a point of reference, the `JSON.parse` method included in JavaScript ignores `__proto__` keys. Simply changing `JSON5.parse` to `JSON.parse` in the examples above mitigates this vulnerability. This vulnerability is patched in json5 versions 1.0.2, 2.2.2, and later.","vulnerability,security,HIGH","high","2024-03-28T14:19:49Z","2024-03-28T14:19:49Z","2024-08-08T19:55:28Z","",,"30","0","https://dev.azure.com/octodemo-felickz/07458afa-663a-4793-bc69-c43e4ced7a96/_git/aadaee5b-159c-46f6-b2e0-bede44f0322a/alerts/699?branch=refs/heads/master","octodemo-felickz","iac-synthetics","iac-synthetics","refs/heads/master",,"",""

It is possible to access any file on the developer&#39;s machine. The middleware can either work with the physical filesystem when reading the files or it can use a virtualized in-memory `memfs` filesystem. If `writeToDisk` configuration option is set to `true`, the physical filesystem is used. The `getFilenameFromUrl` method is used to parse URL and build the local file path. The public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the `unsecaped` path suffix is appended to the `outputPath`. As the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the midlleware, it is possible to use `%2e` and `%2f` sequences to perform path traversal attack.

Developers using `webpack-dev-server` or `webpack-dev-middleware` are affected by the issue. When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer&#39;s machine and exfiltrate the content. If the development server is listening on a public IP address (or `0.0.0.0`), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port). If the server allows access from third-party domains, an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files. Starting with fixed versions 7.1.0, 6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the URL is unescaped and normalized before any further processing.","vulnerability,security,HIGH","high","2024-03-28T14:19:49Z","2024-03-28T14:19:49Z","2024-08-08T19:55:28Z","",,"30","0","https://dev.azure.com/octodemo-felickz/07458afa-663a-4793-bc69-c43e4ced7a96/_git/aadaee5b-159c-46f6-b2e0-bede44f0322a/alerts/700?branch=refs/heads/master","octodemo-felickz","iac-synthetics","iac-synthetics","refs/heads/master",,"",""
